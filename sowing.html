<h1>Sowing seeds</h1>

<div class="blog-paragraph">
<p>Flaxseeds, also known as linseeds, are a great source of fiber and omega-3 fats, particularly alpha-linolenic acid (ALA).</p>
<p>However, the omega-3 fats are contained within the fibrous outer shell of the seed, which humans can’t digest easily.</p>
<p>A 1-ounce (28-gram) serving of flaxseeds contains a wide mix of nutrients (3):</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>fiber:</b>15%</li>
    <li><b>fiber:</b>15%</li>
    <li><b>fiber:</b>15%</li>
    <li><b>fiber:</b>15%</li>
    <li><b>fiber:</b>15%</li>
    <li><b>fiber:</b>15%</li>
    <li><b>fiber:</b>15%</li>
    <li><b>fiber:</b>15%</li>
    
</ul>
<p>Flaxseeds also contain a number of different polyphenols, especially lignans, which act as important antioxidants in the body</p>
<p>Lignans, as well as the fiber and omega-3 fats in flaxseeds, can all help reduce cholesterol and other risk factors for heart disease</p>
<p>One large study combined the results of 28 others, finding that consuming flaxseeds reduced levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol by an average of 10 mmol/</p>
<p>Your body can convert ALA into other omega-3 fats, such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which are the omega-3 fats found in oily fish. However, this conversion process in the body is usually quite inefficient.</p>
<p>One study has shown that chia seeds may be able to increase levels of EPA in the blood</p>
<p>Chia seeds may also help reduce blood sugar. A couple of studies have shown that whole and ground chia seeds are equally effective for reducing blood sugar immediately after a meal</p>
<p>Another study found that, as well as reducing blood sugar, chia seeds may reduce appetite</p>
<p>Chia seeds may also reduce risk factors of heart disease</p>
<p>A study of 20 people with type 2 diabetes found that eating 37 grams of chia seeds per day for 12 weeks reduced blood pressure and levels of several inflammatory chemicals, including C-reactive protein (CRP)</p>
